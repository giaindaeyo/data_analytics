--Just a little background

Ever since high school, when I discovered that I love wrapping my head around mathematical concepts, finding connections between just about anything,
I aspired to get into a career that will make a good use of these skills. Fast forward, I got a degree in Accounting and currently work as an accounting 
support in a government agency. I can say that the job pays well which I am grateful but not nearly enough as to give me the ULTIMATE freedom -
which is the TIME to do the things I'm really passionate about.
